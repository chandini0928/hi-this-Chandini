## 🌟 Featured Projects
- **[Prediction and Optimization of Blast Furnace Parameters using Artificial Neural Network](#)**  
  A blast furnace is a crucial component in the iron and steel industry, used primarily for the extraction of iron from its ores. The process involves the chemical reduction of iron ore (mostly consisting of iron oxides) to produce molten iron, commonly known as pig iron, which can then be further refined to produce steel.
